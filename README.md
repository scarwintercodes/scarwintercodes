## Hi there 👋 My name is Scar Winter Kelsey. Yes, Scar like the fictional villain, but a real life person instead. 🦁

I am a data professional passionate about making complex technical concepts accessible and actionable. Currently serving as a Lead Data Analyst at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, I specialize in bridging the gap between intricate data systems and the people who need to understand them.

My journey spans healthcare analytics, technology training, and data governance, where I've consistently focused on enhancing team efficiency and building robust data solutions. I thrive on transforming complex datasets into clear insights using R, Python, and SQL, while ensuring that the stories behind the numbers are understood by all stakeholders.

With a background in both Information Systems Management and Political Science, I bring a unique perspective to data analysis that combines technical expertise with strong communication skills. I particularly enjoy mentoring junior analysts and creating user-friendly technical documentation that makes data science more approachable.
