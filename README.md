## üß™ About This Page
My Github is my personal laboratory. This is where I test ideas and bring them to life. Currently, I'm finalizing development and deployment of my professional website: written in R through Quarto, and deployed either through Netlify, Quarto Pub, or Github Pages (I'm experimenting with them all!). I'm also working on some search and automation tools using BeautifulSoup and Selenium (Python).
