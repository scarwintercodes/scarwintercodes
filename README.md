# Hi, I'm Scar!
> Yes, Scar like the fictional villain, but a real life person instead. 🦁

## ⚙ About Me
I am a tech professional passionate about making complex technical concepts accessible and actionable. Currently serving as a Lead Data Analyst at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, I specialize in bridging the gap between intricate information systems and the people who need to understand them. 

## ℹ️ About This Page
My Github is my personal labratory. This is where I test ideas and bring them to life. Currently, I'm finalizing development and deployment of my professional website: written in R through Quarto, and deployed either by Netlify or Quarto Pub.
